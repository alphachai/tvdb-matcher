# TVDB Matcher

I threw this together to clean up my TV media. Nothing special here, but it might save you time too.


## Example

### Command
```bash
python clean.py --dryrun=False --apikey=TVDB_API_KEY --user=TVDB_USERNAME --userkey=TVDB_USER_KEY --showid=TVDB_SHOW_ID /path/to/your/media
```

### output
> Matched S1931E9 Smile Darn Ya Smile with S1931E9 "Smile, Darn Ya, Smile!" with 100% certainty.
> Matched S1955E26 Red Riding Hoodwinked with S1955E26 "Red Riding Hoodwinked" with 100% certainty.
> Matched S1931E13 You Dont Know What Youre Doin with S1931E13 "You Don't Know What You're Doin'!" with 100% certainty.
> Matched S1956E11 Gee Whizzzzzzz with S1956E11 "Gee Whiz-z-z-z-z-z-z" with 100% certainty.
